// LUABIND_NO_ERROR_CHECKING
// define this to remove all error checks
// this will improve performance and memory
// footprint.
// if it is defined matchers will only be called on
// overloaded functions, functions that's
// not overloaded will be called directly. The
// parameters on the lua stack are assumed
// to match those of the function.
// exceptions will still be catched when there's
// no error checking.

// LUABIND_DONT_COPY_STRINGS
// define this if you only pass static constant strings to
// the def() methods. It will make luabind expect the
// strings to exist as long as the program is running.
// Luabind will not copy the strings in this case.

// LUABIND_NOT_THREADSAFE
// this define will make luabind non-thread safe. That is,
// it will rely on a static variable. You can still have
// multiple lua states and use coroutines, but only
// one of your real threads may run lua code.

// If you don't want to use the rtti supplied by C++
// you can supply your own type-info structure with the
// LUABIND_TYPE_INFO define. Your type-info structure
// must be copyable and it must be able to compare itself
// against other type-info structures. You supply the compare
// function through the LUABIND_TYPE_INFO_EQUAL()
// define. It should compare the two type-info structures
// it is given and return true if they represent the same type
// and false otherwise. You also have to supply a function
// to generate your type-info structure. You do this through
// the LUABIND_TYPEID() define. It takes a type as it's
// parameter. That is, a compile time parameter. To use it
// you probably have to make a traits class with specializations
// for all classes that you have type-info for.

// returns values that cannot be converted by the given policy.
// Luabind requires that no function called directly or indirectly
// by luabind throws an exception (throwing exceptions through
// C code has undefined behavior, lua is written in C).
