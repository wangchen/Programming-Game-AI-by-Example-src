//  Name:   SoccerTeam.h
//
//  Desc:   class to define a team of soccer playing agents. A SoccerTeam
//          contains several field players and one goalkeeper. A SoccerTeam
//          is implemented as a finite state machine and has states for
//          attacking, defending, and KickOff.
