//  Name: PlayerBase.h
//
//  Desc: Definition of a soccer player base class. The player inherits
//        from the autolist class so that any player created will be
//        automatically added to a list that is easily accesible by any
//        other game objects. (mainly used by the steering behaviors and
//        player state classes)
